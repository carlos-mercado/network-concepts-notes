Stuff that I found useful in this proj.

The instructions are very helpful don't try to implements without reading them. You will save yourself an hour or more in time. 

The functions we implemented in the prev project are very important. I grabbed the file and put in the same dir as the rest of the
files.

You can import the function like so:

`import netfuncs`

After you get a output from the function that looks right you can redirect the output to a file like so (LINUX):

`python dijkstra.py example.json > myout.txt`

Then you can just 

`diff myout.txt example1_output.txt` to see if the files match.

That easy.
